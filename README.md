### This is an year old project which had missing README, which I am adding in this commit.


# Mail It
A flask plus sqlAlchemy (postgresql) web app, with vanilla js frontend, for sending and receiving mails. Deployed on Vercel, [live preview here](http://mailit.vercel.app/)

# Why I did this
To learn more about the core js funcionality instead of delving into abstract frameworks, and to better appreciate frameworks like reactJs.

# Tools Used
Sqlalchemy is the elephant in the room here, I have some very intricate queries and some usual ones. Postgresql, flask, wtForms and just that.
